# Note on the job-level `if` conditions:
# This workflow is designed such that:
# 1. Run ALL jobs when a 'push', 'workflow_dispatch' triggered the workflow or on 'pull_request's which have set auto_merge=true or have the label "CICD:run-e2e-tests".
# 2. Run ONLY the docker image building jobs on PRs with the "CICD:build-images" label.
# 3. Run NOTHING when neither 1. or 2.'s conditions are satisfied.
