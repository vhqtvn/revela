  # Run the TS SDK examples. Note: There are small windows where these examples
  # might be able to fail. For example, if we released a new devnet and SDK with
  # an incompatible change, but haven't updated the examples to use the new SDK.
  # That's why this is a separate job, because there are times when it could fail,
  # whereas there is no reason why the test-sdk-confirm-client-generated-publish
  # job should fail. These could also fail because we run them against devnet,
  # whereas we run the test-sdk-confirm-client-generated-publish against a node
  # built from the same commit and run as part of that CI job.
