# !!!!! WARNING !!!!!
#
#   To update the Move dependencies, you MUST perform a search and replace throughout
#   the whole repo. This is because we now have crates that directly depends on some Move
#   crates, to dodge feature unification issues. Please DO NOT make them use move-deps,
#   or you risk including testing only features in the production build.
#
#   The language team is aware of the poor user experience this created, and we are
#   actively looking for solutions.
