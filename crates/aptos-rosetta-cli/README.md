## Rosetta CLI

The Rosetta CLI is used for testing, and is not used for any production use case.  The CLI uses the same client as the end to end tests to ensure consistency, but with the caveat that it will panicc for cases that aren't expected.

The design of this CLI is to let developers that know about the Aptos ecosystem to simply call Rosetta APIs while actively developing on Rosetta.

You can get more help about the commands with `aptos-rosetta-cli --help`
