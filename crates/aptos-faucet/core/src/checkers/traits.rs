// Note: At one point I had an undo function that worked like this:
//
//   If a Checker returned no rejection reasons, but a later Checker
//   did, the first checker might want to undo anything it did. It can
//   do so in this function.
//
// I decided this was needlessly complex, and I saw a few ways it could
// be possible to abuse this mechanism to overload the tap if the `undo`
// implementation wasn't very careful. So I removed it. This means that
// this scenario is possible:
//
//   1. User makes request.
//   2. It passes some ratelimiting check and we increment the ratelimit.
//   3. It fails some other check.
//   4. We reject the request, without decrementing the ratelimit.
//
// Indeed, this is probably desirable behavior anyway.

/// Implementers of this trait are responsible for checking something about the
/// request, and if it doesn't look valid, returning a list of rejection reasons
/// explaining why. It may also do something extra after the funding happened
/// if there is something to clean up afterwards.
