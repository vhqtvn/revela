This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Aptos project.

<BlockQuote type="info">
As Aptos Core is currently in the prototype stage and does not power a blockchain with a cryptocurrency that has real-world value, our security procedures are not fully in place.
We will release a more complete disclosure policy prior to the launch of the mainnet.
