# Aptos Developer Network

Welcome! Aptos is building a Layer 1 for everyone. Here in our documentation you can explore tutorials and technical concepts for the Aptos Network.

## Want to dive in?

- Start with the basics, such as [Transactions and States](/concepts/basics-txns-states.md) and how [Accounts](/concepts/basics-accounts.md) work. 

- Want something a bit more interactive? You can dive right into [Aptos Quickstarts](/tutorials/index.md).

Or you can go straight to the [aptos-core source](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) and help us build the Layer 1 for everyone.

:::info Devnet Resets
We will reset the devnet every Thursday Morning (PST). See the latest updates in [Aptos Discord][discord].

## Got a question?

Join our [Discord][discord] to speak with our developers and hop into the Aptos community. It's the best way to keep up to date with news and developments in the Aptos universe. Be sure to check pinned messages in the channels - this is where we like to keep topic-specific links, events, and more.

Or even if you just want to stop by to say "Good Morning!". There's a little something for everyone!

:::caution Be safe out there

It's dangerous to go alone. Please remember, our community managers will never message or DM you first, and they will never ask you to send them money or share any sensitive, private, or personal information. If this happens to you, please report it to us in our [Discord][discord], or by sending an email to [security@aptoslabs.com](mailto:security@aptoslabs.com).
