# Install CLI by script

The `aptos` tool is a command line interface (CLI) for developing on the Aptos blockchain, debugging Move contracts, and conducting node operations. This document describes how to install the `aptos` CLI tool using the automated install script.

First, ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed:
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.9.13
```
If it is not installed, you can find installation instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
