## Install from the GitHub repo

For the latest development release, install the extension from GitHub:

2. Open a Chrome window and navigate to the *Extensions* using any of the below methods:
    - At the top-right corner of the browser window, click the three vertical dots and then **More tools** > **Extensions**
    - On a new tab or window type `chrome://extensions` in the URL field and press return.
