# Prepare your Aptos Dev Environment

To kickstart your journey in the Aptos ecosystem, set up your environment as needed by your role. To interact with Aptos, you may simply [install the Aptos command line interface (CLI)](#install-the-cli). To develop Aptos itself, you will need to [clone the Aptos-core repository](#clone-the-aptos-core-repo).

See the [Workflows](#workflows) for use cases associated with each path. See the [Aptos developer resources](#aptos-developer-resources) for quick links to Aptos networks, SDKs, and other tools.

## Use supported operating systems

Aptos can be built on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS. and Windows. Aptos is tested extensively on Linux and macOS, and less so on Windows. Here are the versions we use:

* Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 and 22.04
* macOS - macOS Monterey and later
* Microsoft Windows - Windows 10, 11 and Windows Server 2022+

See [Installing Aptos CLI](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli.md) for instructions by operating system.

## Meet hardware requirements

Aptos requires no specific hardware to develop on the blockchain. To run one of our nodes, see the hardware requirements for:

* [Fullnodes](../nodes/full-node/fullnode-source-code-or-docker.md#hardware-requirements)
* [Validators](../nodes/validator-node/operator/node-requirements.md#hardware-requirements)

## Workflows

### CLI only

Most Aptos users will want to have the Aptos CLI installed. [Install](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli.md) and [use](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/use-aptos-cli.md) the Aptos CLI if you will:

* [Run a local testnet](../nodes/local-testnet/using-cli-to-run-a-local-testnet.md).
* [Manage accounts](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/use-aptos-cli.md#account-examples).
* [Generate keys](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/use-aptos-cli.md#key-examples).
* [Compile Move packages](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/use-aptos-cli.md#move-examples).

### Source code and CLI

In addition to installing the CLI, [clone](#clone-the-aptos-core-repo) and [review](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) the Aptos repository if you will:

* [Run a fullnode](../nodes/full-node/index.md).
* [Run a validator node](../nodes/validator-node/index.md).
* [Take the starter tutorials](../tutorials/index.md), many of which rely upon Aptos source code.
* [Extend and contribute](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) to the Aptos blockchain itself; [pull requests](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pulls) welcome!

Although Docker options exist for many of these configurations, you should download the Aptos source to become familiar with the inner workings of the blockchain once you are conducting this more advanced work.

:::tip Find information in the source
The [Aptos source files](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) themselves also contain a wealth of information in docs comments worth reviewing.

## Install the Aptos CLI

[Install the Aptos CLI](../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/index.md) to interact with the Aptos network. As a developer in the Aptos ecosystem, set up your development environment as described in the link.
This tool will help you compile, test, and publish contracts as well as run contracts directly on the blockchain.

## Building Aptos From Source

See [Building Aptos From Source](building-from-source.md)

## Create and fund test accounts

Use the Aptos CLI and wallet of your choice to create and fund an Aptos account in `testnet` (or `devnet`). For more options and details, see [Create and Fund Aptos Accounts](./get-test-funds.md).

## Understand the Aptos Token Standard

The [Aptos Token Standard](../concepts/coin-and-token/index.md) lays out the rules for creating and distributing digital assets on the Aptos blockchain.

## Find Aptos developer resources
