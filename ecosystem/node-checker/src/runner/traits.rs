// This runner doesn't block in the multithreading sense, but from the user
// perspective. To run the health check, we pull metrics once, wait, and then
// pull the metrics again. It does not support continually running beyond this
// point. You can imagine smarter versions of this where you store the last seen
// set of metrics, then compare against that, or perhaps even multiple previously
// seen sets of metrics and do more complex analysis. Additionally we could leverage
// things like long polling +/ sticky routing to make it that the client request
// doesn't just hang waiting for the run to complete.
